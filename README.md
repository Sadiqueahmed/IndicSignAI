# IndicSignAI: A Hybrid AI System for Assamese Text to Indian Sign Language Animation

> Bridging Multilingual Accessibility through AI-Driven Translation, Speech Synthesis, and Sign Language Animation

---

## 🧭 Abstract

**IndicSignAI** presents a novel, end-to-end AI framework designed to facilitate inclusive communication by translating **Assamese text** into **English speech** and finally rendering **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** animations. This system is tailored for the **Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH)** community in India, enabling equitable access to information in multilingual environments.

Leveraging advancements in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** synthesis, **rule-based glossification**, and **3D sign avatar animation**, IndicSignAI demonstrates modular, scalable, and real-time translation across sensory and linguistic modalities.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

India’s linguistic diversity and the underrepresentation of regional languages in AI-driven accessibility tools hinder effective communication for the DHH population. Existing ISL translation systems largely support Hindi or English, excluding speakers of low-resource languages like Assamese. This project addresses:
- The **absence of Assamese–ISL translation pipelines**
- **Lack of standardized ISL grammar**
- **Minimal digital representation** of Indian regional languages

---

## 🧠 System Overview

The framework is structured as a **four-stage AI pipeline**:

1. **Neural Machine Translation**
   - Tool: *IndicTrans2*
   - Input: Assamese text → Output: English text

2. **Text-to-Speech Synthesis**
   - Tools: *Tacotron2*, *FastSpeech2*
   - Input: English text → Output: Natural-sounding English audio

3. **ISL Gloss Generation**
   - Tools: *Rule-based SVO restructuring*, *T5-based sequence models*
   - Input: English text → Output: ISL-compatible gloss

4. **ISL Avatar Animation**
   - Tools: *Blender*, *SignAvatar*, *OpenPose*, *MediaPipe*
   - Input: ISL gloss → Output: 3D sign language animation (.mp4)

## 🧩 Architectural Flow

```plaintext
[Assamese Text]
     ↓ IndicTrans2
[English Text]
     ↓ Tacotron2 / FastSpeech2 --------→ [English Audio]
     ↓ Glossifier (T5 / Rule-based)
[ISL Gloss]
     ↓ SignAvatar + Blender
[3D ISL Animation Output]
```

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IndicSignAI.git
cd IndicSignAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Blender must be installed and accessible via command-line (`blender --background`) for animation rendering.

## 📌 Key Challenges

- Scarcity of Assamese–English–ISL aligned datasets
- ISL lacks formal grammatical structure for automation
- Difficulty in capturing facial expressions & non-manual markers
- Limited availability of expressive, animated sign avatars

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Expand gloss corpora via human annotation and crowdsourcing
- Integrate **facial expression synthesis** for emotional nuance
- Extend support to additional Indian languages (e.g., Bengali, Manipuri)
- Build lightweight ONNX/TensorRT models for **mobile deployment**
