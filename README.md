# IndicSignAI

**A Hybrid AI Framework for Assamese Text → English Speech → Indian Sign Language Animation**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**IndicSignAI** is a modular, AI-powered translation system that bridges communication between Assamese speakers and the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community by translating Assamese text into:
- ✅ English speech
- ✅ Indian Sign Language (ISL) animation

This end-to-end pipeline addresses accessibility, inclusivity, and linguistic diversity in India by leveraging state-of-the-art models in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and 3D gesture animation.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔄 **Assamese to English Translation** using [IndicTrans2](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicTrans2)
- 🔊 **English Text-to-Speech** with Tacotron2 or FastSpeech2
- ✍️ **English to ISL Gloss Conversion** via grammar simplification or T5 models
- 🧍 **Sign Avatar Animation** using SignAvatar, Blender, OpenPose, or MediaPipe

## 🔧 System Architecture

```plaintext
[Assamese Text]
      ↓ M1: IndicTrans2
[English Text]
      ↓ M2: Tacotron2/FastSpeech2 --------→ 🎧 English Audio
      ↓ M3: Rule-based/T5 glossifier
[ISL Gloss]
      ↓ M4: Blender + SignAvatar
[ISL Animation Video Output]
```

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IndicSignAI.git
cd IndicSignAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> You may need to separately install Blender and configure `blender --background` for headless animation rendering.

---

## 📌 Challenges

- Lack of large-scale Assamese–English–ISL aligned data
- Absence of standardized ISL grammar
- Difficulty in rendering non-manual signs (facial expressions, emotion)
- Limited avatar gesture realism

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Collect larger annotated datasets
- Integrate facial expression and emotion modeling
- Extend to other regional languages (e.g., Bengali, Manipuri)
- Develop cross-platform mobile/web deployment
