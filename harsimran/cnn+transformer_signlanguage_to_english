Great! Since you're using the **WLASL (Word-Level American Sign Language)** dataset, here is an updated version of the `README.md` with that included:

---

## 🧠 Sign Language to English Sentence Prediction (CNN + Transformer)

This project implements a deep learning model that translates **sign language videos** into **English sentences** using a hybrid **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **Transformer** architecture. It leverages the **WLASL dataset** for training and evaluation.

### 🚀 Features

* ✅ Preprocessing of WLASL video clips
* ✅ CNN (e.g., MobileNetV2) for feature extraction
* ✅ Transformer for temporal sequence modeling
* ✅ Sentence generation from sign sequences
* ✅ Scalable and modular pipeline for future real-time support

### 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-translator.git
cd sign-language-translator
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📊 Dataset: WLASL

We use the **WLASL (Word-Level American Sign Language)** dataset, a large-scale dataset with 2,000+ unique signs across thousands of video samples.

* Official Site: [https://github.com/dxli94/WLASL](https://github.com/dxli94/WLASL)
* Each video represents a single word or phrase from a native ASL signer.
* You may optionally preprocess the videos into frames stored per word for faster loading.

Example directory structure:

```
dataset/
  ├── agree/
  │     ├── video_001.jpg
  │     ├── video_002.jpg
  ├── book/
  └── ...
```

---

### 🧪 Usage

1. Launch the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook cnn+transformer.ipynb
```

2. Inside the notebook:

   * Load WLASL data (video or pre-extracted frames)
   * Extract features using CNN
   * Train Transformer model
   * Predict English words/sentences

---

### 🔧 Model Architecture

* **CNN Backbone**: Extracts spatial features from individual video frames (e.g., using MobileNetV2).
* **Transformer**: Encodes frame sequences and decodes to English sentence predictions.
* **Positional Encoding**: Added to maintain temporal order.

---

### 📈 Results

You can add your model evaluation results here, e.g.:

* **Top-1 Accuracy**: 78.4%
* **BLEU Score**: 0.62
* Sample Predictions:

  * Sign input: `HELLO`, `MY`, `NAME` → Predicted: `"Hello, my name is..."`

---
### 📌 Future Improvements

* Expand from word-level to continuous signing
* Integrate real-time webcam/video stream input
* Add signer-independent recognition techniques

Would you like me to generate a `requirements.txt` for this project as well, based on common dependencies used in CNN + Transformer + WLASL pipelines?
